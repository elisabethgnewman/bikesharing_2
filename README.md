## Overview of Project
In the module, we learned all about Tableau! We used the application to visualize data in many different ways and create dashboards and stories of the data. We used the NYC Bike Ride sharing data from Citi Bike System and specifically looked at the ride data from August 2019. We broke the data down by gender, start time/stop time, start location/end location, and much more. 

## Results
The most common bike ride start times were 8am and 5pm.

As shown above, there are many different ways you can present/visualize the same data. Understanding your audience and the best way to communicate information is very important.

Males made up the most rides, but females had the longest average ride.

We also looked at the data based on user type. Users could either be: customers or subscribers. It appears that subscribers are the people who use the app for work and customers use the app more on the weekends.

## Summary
Overall, male users were the biggest driver of the bike ride app in August of 2019. As shown above, they tend to use the app mostly during the week at the peak hours of 8am and 5pm. It's important to note that this data is only reflective of one month in one year. I would propose that we look at the data from the entire year to determine if there is any seasonality. Are there less users in the winter months because of snow? Or are there more users in the winter months because people don't want to walk in the cold? 

We also had birthdate in the data, so we could perform an analysis on the age of the users as well. The more *complete* data you can gather, the better you can understand your consumer!
